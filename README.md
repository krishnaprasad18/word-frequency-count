WORD-FREQUENCY-COUNT APPLICATION.
NETLIFY LINK: https://sage-ganache-4a2bb9.netlify.app

This is a Word Frequency Count application built using React.js. It allows you to fetch the contents of a text file, calculate the frequency of each word in the text, and plot a histogram of the 20 most occurring words. Additionally, it provides an option to export the histogram data as a CSV file.

FEATURES:

Fetch the contents of a text file from a specified URL Calculate the frequency of occurrence of each word in the text Plot a histogram of the 20 most occurring words Export the histogram data as a CSV file

INSTALLATION:

1.Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/word-frequency-count.git

2.Navigate to the project directory: cd word-frequency-count

3.Install the dependencies: npm install

4.Start the application: npm start

5.Open the application in your browser: http://localhost:3000

USAGE:

1.On the first load, you will see a "Submit" button.

2.Click on the "Submit" button to fetch the contents of a text file. The application will fetch the contents from the URL https://www.terriblytinytales.com/test.txt.

3.The application will then calculate the frequency of occurrence of each word in the text.

4.A histogram of the 20 most occurring words will be displayed on the page. The X-axis represents the top 20 words with the highest occurrence, and the Y-axis represents how many times they occurred in the file.

5.Click on the "Export" button to download a CSV file of the histogram data.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:

This application was built using React.js, a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

The data fetching is handled using the axios library.

The histogram visualization is created using the recharts library.

Special thanks to the developers and contributors of the libraries and resources used in this project.

Feel free to customize this README file based on your specific project details, dependencies, and requirements. Provide clear instructions for installation, usage, and any other relevant information to help users understand and use your Word Frequency Count application.# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
